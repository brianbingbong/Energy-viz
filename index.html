    <h1>How The World Used its Energy in 2016</h1>

                Only 15% of the world's energy comes from renewable or nuclear sources, 85% still comes from fossil
                fuels in relatively equal proportions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-5-12">
            <p>
                It was recorded that 185/212 use some form of renewable/nuclear energy, although only approximately half
                of the countries derived 10% of more from it.
                Only 14 countries derive the majority of their energy from renewable/nuclear energy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-7-24">
            <p>
                Most countries which use a higher proportion of renewable/nuclear energy have a lower energy to co2
                production ratio, although outliers exist like the
                Falkland Islands and Montenegro. Countries also exist which use almost no renewable energy with low
                energy to co2 production ratios like Singapore and
                Malta.

                Generally developed nations use the most energy per capita, and subsequently produce the most CO2 per
                capita. Australia, Canada, the United States,
                Russia Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia and Iceland are the highest energy and CO2 producers
            </p>

            <p class="left-border-text">
                The majority of the continent of Africa use a miniscule amount of energy, with Chad using as less as
                325BTU per capita a year in comparison to the
                hundreds of thousands of other nations. Carbon dioxide production in Africa is very low as a result.

                Renewable/nuclear energy makes up a considerable portion of the energy usage in developing nations
                in South America and Africa. Namely, Paraguay uses 77% and the Democratic Republic of Congo uses 67%
                among other closeby nations also using considerable amounts.

            <p class="left-border-text">
                Among developed nations, Sweden and Norway are leaders, using 66% and 68% renewable/nuclear energy.
                Other European countries, as well as New Zealand and Canada use a considerable amount between 25%
                and 50% while large nations such as Australia, China, Russia and the United states use coniserably
                less renewable/nuclear energy.
